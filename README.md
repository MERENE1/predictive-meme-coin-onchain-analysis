# predictive-meme-coin-onchain-analysis
This project applies a behavioral on-chain framework to compare two Ethereum meme coins and evaluate whether **early behavioral signals can distinguish strong performers from weaker ones**.  Rather than explaining price action after the fact, the goal is to identify **predictive signals** observable *before* major trading expansions.
